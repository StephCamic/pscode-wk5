// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers


Input num1 and num2
num1 + num2 = sum
print sum


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd


Input number
IF number / 2 = whole number
	print EVEN
ELSE print ODD


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


Input number1, number2, number3, number4, & number5

number1 + number2 + number3 + number4 + number5 = sum
sum / 5 = AVERAGE
	print AVERAGE
print "THE NUMBER ABOVE IS THE AVERAGE OF YOUR 5 NUMBERS."

IF number1 < number 2, number 3, number4, & number5
	print number1 SMALLEST
ELSE number2 < number1, number3, number4, & number5
	print number2 SMALLEST
ELSE number3 < number1, number2, number4, & number5
	print number3 SMALLEST
ELSE number4 < number1, number2, number3, & number5
	print number4 SMALLEST
ELSE number5 < number1, number2, number3, & number4
	print number5 SMALLEST
print "THE NUMBER ABOVE IS THE SMALLEST OF YOUR 5 NUMBERS."

IF number1 > number 2, number 3, number4, & number5
	print number1 LARGEST
ELSE number2 > number1, number3, number4, & number5
	print number2 LARGEST
ELSE number3 > number1, number2, number4, & number5
	print number3 LARGEST
ELSE number4 > number1, number2, number3, & number5
	print number4 LARGEST
ELSE number5 > number1, number2, number3, & number4
	print number5 LARGEST
print "THE NUMBER ABOVE IS THE LARGEST OF YOUR 5 NUMBERS."
